  "PomeStoneOpsAdvisor -- the contained LLM/decision node. This actor's
  intelligence layer proposes back-office coordination actions (orchard
  record logging, field-operation scheduling, crop-health-concern flags,
  supply procurement) based on orchard/block state and operator input.
  The advisor is SEALED into the `:advise` step of the operation flow;
  every proposal is routed through the independent Governor before
  committing.

  The advisor makes proposals but has NO direct authority. Proposals are
  always censored by:
    1. Governor (orchard registration, closed-op allowlist, cost/health
       gates)
    2. Phase gate (rollout stage)
    3. Human operator (for escalated actions)

  Current implementation is a mock advisor for testing. Production should
  use langchain/Claude or similar LLM backend (same seam point as
  `citrusops.advisor`, cloud-itonami-isic-0123)."
