(ns pomestoneops.store
  "Store abstraction for pome- and stone-fruit orchard block/planting
  records. Current implementation is an in-memory map; production should
  migrate to Datomic/kotoba-server (the same seam point all cloud-itonami
  actors use). Mirrors `citrusops.store` (cloud-itonami-isic-0123) in
  shape.

  A registered orchard block is the minimal unit of authority: an
  orchard/block must be registered before ANY proposal referencing it can
  be considered by the Governor (see `pomestoneops.governor`'s
  `orchard-registered` invariant). Orchard data is opaque to this
  namespace -- callers/backends decide what an orchard record contains
  (name, location, pome/stone-fruit species, planted area, etc); this
  Store only answers \"is this orchard-id registered, and if so what's on
  file\".")
