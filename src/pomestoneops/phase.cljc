(ns pomestoneops.phase
  "Phase gate for the pome- and stone-fruit orchard operations
  coordinator rollout (0->3 maturity). Mirrors `citrusops.phase`
  (cloud-itonami-isic-0123) in shape, adapted to this actor's simpler op
  set (no separate request-level :stake -- the request's :op IS the
  stake, since every op this actor may propose is already
  coordination-only).

  Phase 0: simulation/test only -- NO proposal ever autonomously commits;
    even a Governor-clean proposal escalates for human review.
  Phase 1: supervised operation -- always-escalate ops
    (`pomestoneops.governor/always-escalate-ops`) escalate even when
    clean; other ops commit if the Governor approves.
  Phase 2: reduced supervision -- escalate only on Governor
    violation/low-confidence/high-cost; routine ops commit.
  Phase 3: full autonomy -- the Governor's verdict is authoritative.

  See `operation.cljc` for how the phase gate is invoked."
