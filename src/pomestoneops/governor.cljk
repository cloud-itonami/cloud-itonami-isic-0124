  "Pome- and Stone-Fruit Operations Governor -- the independent
  compliance layer that earns the PomeStoneOpsAdvisor the right to
  commit. The LLM has no notion of:
    - Whether the orchard/block a proposal targets is actually registered
    - Whether a proposal is a real actuation (`:effect :propose` only --
      this actor NEVER directly operates field equipment or finalizes a
      spray-application decision)
    - Whether an op is inside this actor's closed coordination allowlist
    - Whether a logged orchard-record quantity is a plausible positive
      observation
    - Whether a supply-order's cost exceeds the escalation threshold

  This MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall
  back to HOLD.

  This actor is a back-office OPERATIONS COORDINATOR only -- direct field
  equipment operation and spray-application decisions are categorically
  outside its authority (grower/agronomist exclusive). The Governor
  enforces that boundary structurally, not by trusting the advisor's
  judgment.

  CRITICAL: Any proposal to flag a crop health concern (codling moth,
  fire blight, frost-damage) ALWAYS escalates to a human (grower/
  agronomist) for final sign-off. The LLM's confidence is never
  sufficient for crop-health decisions.

  Hard violations (always HOLD, no override, permanent):
    1. Orchard/block not registered (orchard-id missing or unknown to
       Store)
    2. Proposal `:effect` is not `:propose` (no direct execution, ever)
    3. Op is `:operate-field-equipment` or `:finalize-spray-application` --
       direct field-equipment operation and finalizing a spray-application
       decision are PERMANENTLY blocked regardless of proposal content or
       confidence
    4. Op is outside the closed proposal-op allowlist
    5. `:log-orchard-record` with a non-positive logged quantity

  Soft gates (always escalate for human):
    - `:flag-crop-health-concern` -- ALWAYS escalates
    - `:order-supplies` above its category cost threshold
    - Low confidence

  This design mirrors `citrusops.governor` (cloud-itonami-isic-0123) but
  specializes pome/stone-fruit orchard back-office coordination concerns
  (orchard/block registration, closed op allowlist, field-equipment/
  spray-application exclusion, cost threshold) rather than citrus-fruit
  concerns."
