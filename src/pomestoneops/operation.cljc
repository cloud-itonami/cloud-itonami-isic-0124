  "OperationActor -- one pome/stone-fruit orchard operation = one
  supervised actor run. The advisor (PomeStoneOpsAdvisor) is sealed into
  a single node (:advise); its proposal is ALWAYS routed through the
  Pome- and Stone-Fruit Operations Governor (:govern) and the rollout
  phase gate (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore today; Datomic/kotoba-server is the next
                     seam)
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)

  One run = one orchard coordination operation (intake -> advise ->
  govern -> decide -> commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner loop
  -- each operation is auditable and checkpointed. An orchard/block's
  operating history is advanced by MANY operations (log-orchard-record /
  schedule-field-operation / flag-crop-health-concern / order-supplies),
  each its own independent run.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow: an `:escalate` disposition
  hands the decision to a human operator (grower / orchard manager /
  agronomist). The approver resumes the pending request once a decision
  is made. `:flag-crop-health-concern` ALWAYS reaches escalation when the
  Governor is clean -- see `pomestoneops.governor/always-escalate-ops`.

  NOTE: langgraph-clj StateGraph integration is deferred (mirrors
  `citrusops.operation`, cloud-itonami-isic-0123). This stub version
  defines the high-level flow synchronously; production build wires this
  into a langgraph-clj StateGraph with `interrupt-before` for the
  escalation node and checkpoint-based resume."
