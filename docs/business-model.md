## What we NOT do

- **Spray-application decisions** — the agronomist/grower decides application
- **Crop health/welfare decisions** — the grower decides response actions
- **Economic decisions** (harvest timing, replanting) — remain human authority
- **Direct field-equipment operation** — the robot manages records and logistics only

## Supported Operations

### Orchard Record Logging
- Planting counts and block layout
- Harvest weight and yield tracking
- Brix (sugar content) testing
- Health status notes (logging only, not decision-making)

### Field-Operation Coordination
- Schedule pruning, thinning, spraying, harvest
- Track completed field-operation results
- Propose follow-up field work (not order it directly)

### Crop Health Concern Escalation
- Flag suspected pest pressure (e.g. codling moth)
- Report fungal/bacterial disease (e.g. fire blight), or frost-damage observations
- Automatic escalation to grower/agronomist

### Supply Procurement
- Seedling orders
- Fertilizer orders
- Equipment procurement
- Cost threshold escalation for large orders
