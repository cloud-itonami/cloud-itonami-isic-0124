**Maturity: `:implemented`** — `src/pomestoneops/` implements the reference
PomeStoneOpsAdvisor / PomeStoneOperationsGovernor actor as a synchronous
stub (langgraph-clj StateGraph wiring deferred, see `operation.cljc`).
Contributions that extend coverage are welcome: langgraph-clj StateGraph
integration (real `interrupt-before`/checkpoint-based human-in-the-loop
resume for escalated operations), a Datomic/kotoba-server `Store` backend,
a real LLM `Advisor` implementation, additional Governor rules, and
pome/stone-fruit-species/varietal reference-data expansion in
`pomestoneops.facts`. Open an issue or PR. License: AGPL-3.0-or-later.
